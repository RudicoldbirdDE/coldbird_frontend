         Since our foundation we work with the content management system Wordpress on which we headless to the content requirements of tomorrow. Thus, we fundamentally separate frontend and backend.
         In addition, we like and work well with the following technologies:
         <ul>
           <li>VueJS, Svelte, React, ElectronJS for our Frontend Components</li>
           <li>Wordpress, Drupal for our Backend CMS Management</li>
           <li>Golang, C# (ASP.NET Core) for custom solutions</li>
           <li>WooCommerce</li>
           <li>C++ / Tensorflow for Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI)</li>
         </ul>
         We always coordinate the techniques used with our customers and their requirements.
         We always keep an eye on performance and user experience.
         We orientate ourselves with our skills and frameworks to the state of the art, observe new developments very closely in order to always develop state-of-the-art applications for tomorrow.
