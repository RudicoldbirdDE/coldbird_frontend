        <p>We are very pleased about your interest in our company. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of Coldbird Inc. The use of the Internet pages of the Coldbird Inc. is possible without any indication of personal data. However, if a data subject wants to use special services of our company via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we will generally obtain the consent of the data subject.</p>
        <p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Coldbird Inc. By means of this data protection declaration, our company would like to inform the public about the type, scope and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed of their rights by means of this data protection declaration.</p>
        <p>As the controller, the Coldbird Inc. has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. Nevertheless, Internet-based data transmissions can always be vulnerable to security risks, so that absolute protection cannot be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transmit personal data to us by alternative means, for example by telephone.</p>
        <h4 class="subTitle">1. Definitions</h4>
        <p>The data protection declaration of Coldbird Inc. is based on the terms used by the European Directive and Regulation (EC) when adopting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

        <p>Coldbird Inc.</p>
        <p>Ã„ussere Weberstr. 57</p>
        <p>02763 Zittau</p>
        <p>Germany</p>
        <p>E-Mail: legal@coldbird.cc</p>
        <p>Website: coldbird.cc</p>
        <h4>3. Cookies</h4>
        <p>The internet pages of Coldbird Inc. use cookies. Cookies are text files that are placed and stored on a computer system via an Internet browser.</p>
        <p>Numerous websites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a string of characters by which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This enables the visited Internet pages and servers to distinguish the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific internet browser can be recognized and identified via the unique cookie ID.</p>
        <p>Through the use of cookies, the Coldbird Inc. can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>
        <p>The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Furthermore, cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all common Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be fully usable.</p>
        <h4>4. Collection of General Data and Information</h4>
        <p>The website of the Coldbird Inc. collects a series of general data and information with each call-up of the website by a data subject or automated system. This general data and information is stored in the log files of the server. The following data may be collected: (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system accesses our website (so-called referrer), (4) the sub-websites that are accessed via an accessing system on our website, (5) the date and time of access to the website, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) other similar data and information that serve to avert danger in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>
        <p>When using these general data and information, the Coldbird Inc. does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed (1) to deliver the contents of our website correctly, (2) to optimize the contents of our website and the advertising for these, (3) to ensure the long-term functionality of our information technology systems and the technology of our website, and (4) to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for prosecution in the event of a cyber attack. Therefore, the Coldbird Inc. analyzes anonymously collected data and information on one hand, and on the other hand, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from any personal data submitted by a data subject.</p>
        <p>If the purpose of storage no longer applies or if a storage period prescribed by the European Directive and Regulation or another competent legislator expires, the personal data will be routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>
        <h4>5. Rights of the Data Subject</h4>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">

            <p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectify, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.</p>
          </li>
          <li>

            <p>Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European Directive and Regulation, to obtain from the controller the erasure without delay of personal data concerning him or her, where one of the following reasons applies and insofar as the processing is not necessary:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
              <li>The personal data were collected or otherwise processed for such purposes for which they are no longer necessary.</li>
              <li>The data subject revokes the consent on which the processing was based pursuant to Art. 6(1)(a) DS-GVO or Art. 9(2)(a) DS-GVO and there is no other legal basis for the processing.</li>
              <li>The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to arrange for the deletion of personal data stored by the Coldbird Inc., he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. The employee of the Coldbird Inc. will arrange for the erasure request to be complied with immediately.</p>
            <p>If the personal data has been made public by the Coldbird Inc., and our company as the controller is required to delete the personal data pursuant to Article 17 (1) of the Data Protection Regulation, the Coldbird Inc. taking into account the available technology and the costs of implementation, shall implement reasonable measures, including technical measures, to inform other data controllers which process the published personal data, that the data subject has requested from those other data controllers to erase all links to or copies or replications of the personal data, unless the processing is necessary. The employee of the Coldbird Inc. will arrange the necessary in individual cases.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="offset-xl-1 col-xl-5 col-lg-10 col-9">
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
          <li>
            <h4>e) Right to Restriction of Processing</h4>
            <p>Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European Directive and Regulation, to obtain from the controller the restriction of processing if one of the following conditions is met:</p>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
              <li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.</li>
              <li>The processing is unlawful, the data subject objects to the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of the use of the personal data.</li>
              <li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of processing, but the data subject needs it for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
              <li>Die betroffene Person hat Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung gem. Art. 21 Abs. 1 DS-GVO eingelegt und es steht noch nicht fest, ob die berechtigten GrÃ¼nde des Verantwortlichen gegenÃ¼ber denen der betroffenen Person Ã¼berwiegen.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of personal data stored by the Coldbird Inc., he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. The employee of the Coldbird Inc will arrange the restriction of the processing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>f) Right to data Portability</h4>
            <p>Any person concerned by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European Directive and Regulation, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which have been provided by the data subject to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she also has the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to whom the personal data have been provided, provided that the processing is based on consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR and the processing is carried out by automated means, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, when exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to obtain that the personal data be transferred directly from one controller to another controller, to the extent that this is technically feasible and provided that this does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals.</p>
            <p>In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of the Coldbird Inc.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>g) Right of Objection</h4>
            <p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European Directive and Regulation to object at any time, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning him or her carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>
            <p>The Coldbird Inc. shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
            <p>If the Coldbird Inc. processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data processed for such marketing. This also applies to the profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the Coldbird Inc. to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the Coldbird Inc. will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>
            <p>In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is carried out by the Coldbird Inc. for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the Data Protection Regulation, unless such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</p>
            <p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may directly contact any employee of the Coldbird Inc. or another employee. The data subject is also free to exercise his/her right to object by means of automated procedures using technical specifications in connection with the use of information society services, notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>h) Automated Decisions in Individual Cases Including Profiling</h4>
            <p>Any data subject concerned by the processing of personal data shall have the right, granted by the European Directive and the Regulation, not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her, unless the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and the controller, or (2) is permitted by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject, and that law contains suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is based on the data subject's explicit consent.</p>
            <p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and the data controller, or (2) it is made with the data subject's explicit consent, the Coldbird Inc. shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, which include at least the right to obtain the data subject's involvement on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.</p>
            <p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated decisions, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>i) Right to Revoke Consent under Data Protection Law</h4>
            <p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right granted by the European Directive and Regulation to withdraw consent to the processing of personal data at any time.</p>
            <p>MÃ¶chte die betroffene Person ihr Recht auf Widerruf einer Einwilligung geltend machen, kann sie sich hierzu jederzeit an einen Mitarbeiter des fÃ¼r die Verarbeitung Verantwortlichen wenden.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>6. Privacy Policy on the use and Application of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)</h4>
        <p>The controller has integrated the Google Analytics component (with anonymization function) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis service. Web analysis is the collection, compilation and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects, among other things, data on which website a data subject came to a website from (so-called referrers), which subpages of the website were accessed or how often and for how long a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is predominantly used for the optimization of a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising.</p>
        <p>The operating company of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.</p>
        <p>The controller uses the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp" for web analysis via Google Analytics. By means of this addition, the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is shortened and anonymized by Google if access to our Internet pages takes place from a member state of the European Union or from another state party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the flow of visitors to our website. Google uses the data and information obtained, among other things, to evaluate the use of our website, to compile online reports for us that show the activities on our website, and to provide other services related to the use of our website.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. What cookies are has already been explained above. By setting the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website. By each call of one of the individual pages of this website, which is operated by the controller and on which a Google Analytics component has been integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective Google Analytics component to transmit data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. As part of this technical process, Google obtains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which Google uses, among other things, to track the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently enable commission calculations.</p>
        <p>By means of the cookie, personal information, for example the access time, the location from which an access originated and the frequency of visits to our website by the data subject, is stored. Each time the data subject visits our website, this personal data, including the IP address of the internet connection used by the data subject, is transmitted to Google in the United States of America. This personal data is stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass on this personal data collected via the technical procedure to third parties.</p>
        <p>The data subject can prevent the setting of cookies by our website, as already described above, at any time by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies. Such a setting of the Internet browser used would also prevent Google from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, a cookie already set by Google Analytics can be deleted at any time via the internet browser or other software programs.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the data subject has the option to object to the collection of data generated by Google Analytics and related to the use of this website as well as to the processing of this data by Google and to prevent such processing. For this purpose, the data subject must download and install a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics via JavaScript that no data and information about visits to Internet pages may be transmitted to Google Analytics. The installation of the browser add-on is considered by Google as an objection. If the information technology system of the data subject is deleted, formatted or reinstalled at a later point in time, the data subject must reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics. If the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the data subject or another person within the data subject's sphere of control, it is possible to reinstall or reactivate the browser add-on.</p>
        <p>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google can be found at https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html. Google Analytics is explained in more detail under this link https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/analytics/.</p>
        <h4>7. Legal Basis of the Processing</h4>
        <p>Article 6 I lit. a DS-GVO serves our company as the legal basis for processing operations in which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, as is the case, for example, with processing operations that are necessary for the delivery of goods or the provision of another service or consideration, the processing is based on Article 6 I lit. b DS-GVO. The same applies to such processing operations that are necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for example in cases of inquiries about our products or services. If our company is subject to a legal obligation by which a processing of personal data becomes necessary, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 I lit. c DS-GVO. In rare cases, the processing of personal data might become necessary to protect vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were to be injured on our premises and as a result his or her name, age, health insurance data or other vital information had to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6 I lit. d DS-GVO.
        Finally, processing operations could be based on Art. 6 I lit. f DS-GVO. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overridden. Such processing operations are permitted to us in particular because they were specifically mentioned by the European legislator. In this respect, it took the view that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a customer of the controller (recital 47 sentence 2 DS-GVO).</p>
        <h4>8. Legitimate Interests in the Processing pursued by the Controller or a Third Party</h4>
        <p>If the processing of personal data is based on Article 6 I lit. f DS-GVO, our legitimate interest is the performance of our business activities for the benefit of the well-being of all our employees and our shareholders.</p>
        <h4>9. Duration for which the Personal Data are stored</h4>
        <p>The criterion for the duration of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiry of the period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, provided that it is no longer required for the fulfillment or initiation of the contract.</p>
        <h4>10. Legal or Contractual Requirements to Provide the Personal data; Necessity for the Conclusion of the Contract; Obligation of the Data Subject to Provide the Personal data; Possible Consequences of non-provision</h4>
        <p>We inform you that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or may also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner).
        Sometimes, in order to conclude a contract, it may be necessary for a data subject to provide us with personal data that must subsequently be processed by us. For example, the data subject is obliged to provide us with personal data if our company concludes a contract with him or her. Failure to provide the personal data would mean that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.
        Before providing personal data by the data subject, the data subject must contact one of our employees. Our employee will explain to the data subject on a case-by-case basis whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data, and what the consequences of not providing the personal data would be.

        <h4>11. Existence of automated decision making</h4>
        <p>As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p>
